# Smart Git Commit

## Context Analysis

- Current git status: !`git status --porcelain`
- Staged changes: !`git diff --cached --name-only`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5`

## MANDATORY: No AI attribution

**NEVER** include any of the following in the commit message, body, footer, or trailers:

- `Co-Authored-By` trailers mentioning Claude, Anthropic, or any AI
- Any mention of Claude, Anthropic, AI, or LLM anywhere in the commit
- Any `Signed-off-by`, `Generated-by`, or similar trailers referencing AI

Violating this rule makes the commit invalid. Double-check before executing.

## Your Task

1. Analyze **only the staged changes** (`git diff --cached`) to understand what was modified
2. **NEVER stage additional files.** Do not run `git add`. Only commit what the user has already staged.
3. If nothing is staged, inform the user and stop — do not stage files on their behalf
4. Generate a conventional commit message (feat, fix, docs, etc.) based solely on staged changes
5. Make the message descriptive but concise
6. Execute `git commit` with the generated message — **no Co-Authored-By or AI trailers**
7. Show the commit hash and summary

# Conventional Commit Messages

See how [a minor change](#examples) to your commit message style can make a difference.

<pre>
git commit -m "<b><a href="#types">&lt;type&gt;</a></b></font>(<b><a href="#scopes">&lt;optional scope&gt;</a></b>): <b><a href="#description">&lt;description&gt;</a></b>" \
  -m"<b><a href="#body">&lt;optional body&gt;</a></b>" \
  -m"<b><a href="#footer">&lt;optional footer&gt;</a></b>"
</pre>

## Commit Message Formats

### General Commit

<pre>
<b><a href="#types">&lt;type&gt;</a></b></font>(<b><a href="#scopes">&lt;optional scope&gt;</a></b>): <b><a href="#description">&lt;description&gt;</a></b>
<sub>empty line as separator</sub>
<b><a href="#body">&lt;optional body&gt;</a></b>
<sub>empty line as separator</sub>
<b><a href="#footer">&lt;optional footer&gt;</a></b>
</pre>

### Initial Commit

```
chore: init
```

### Merge Commit

<pre>
Merge branch '<b>&lt;branch name&gt;</b>'
</pre>

<sup>Follows default git merge message</sup>

### Revert Commit

<pre>
Revert "<b>&lt;reverted commit subject line&gt;</b>"
</pre>

<sup>Follows default git revert message</sup>

### Types

- Changes relevant to the API or UI:
  - `feat` Commits that add, adjust or remove a new feature to the API or UI
  - `fix` Commits that fix an API or UI bug of a preceded `feat` commit
- `refactor` Commits that rewrite or restructure code without altering API or UI behavior
  - `perf` Commits are special type of `refactor` commits that specifically improve performance
- `style` Commits that address code style (e.g., white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons) and do not affect
  application behavior
- `test` Commits that add missing tests or correct existing ones
- `docs` Commits that exclusively affect documentation
- `build` Commits that affect build-related components such as build tools, dependencies, project version, CI/CD
  pipelines, ...
- `ops` Commits that affect operational components like infrastructure, deployment, backup, recovery procedures, ...
- `chore` Miscellaneous commits e.g. modifying `.gitignore`, ...
- `claude` Commits that affect `.claude/`

### Scopes

The `scope` provides additional contextual information.

- The scope is an **optional** part
- Allowed scopes vary and are typically defined by the specific project
- **Do not** use issue identifiers as scopes

#### Phoenix Specific Scopes

**Library Scopes (`libs/`):**

- `common` - Common utilities and shared code
- `event-model` - Agnostic event model core
- `algorithm-api` - Algorithm plugin interfaces
- `data-access` - Data access abstractions
- `ui-components` - Design system components
- `data-grid` - High-performance grid library
- `lob-renderer` - Line of Balance renderer
- `config-engine` - Configuration runtime engine

**Domain Scopes (`domains/`):**

- `production-control` - Work Order management domain
- `customer-demand` - Customer Order/Sales Forecast domain
- `supply-planning` - Purchase Order/STO management domain

**Algorithm Scopes (`algorithms/`):**

- `stock-projection` - Stock projection algorithms
- `pegging` - Pegging and allocation algorithms
- `coverage` - Coverage status calculations

**Architecture Scopes:**

- `event-driven` - Event sourcing and propagation
- `latency-tier` - Progressive computation tiers
- `compute-on-write` - Pre-computation pipelines
- `materialized` - Materialized views and caching

**Infrastructure Scopes:**

- `build` - Maven reactor configuration
- `ci` - GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration
- `ci-templates` - Reusable CI templates
- `deps` - Dependency management
- `docker` - Docker configuration
- `docs` - Documentation
- `generators` - Code generators

**Examples:**

- `feat(event-model): add milestone support for WO events`
- `feat(production-control): implement WO 360 view`
- `fix(pegging): correct FIFO allocation for STOs`
- `refactor(data-grid): optimize virtualized rendering for 300M events`
- `perf(compute-on-write): add incremental KPI computation pipeline`
- `feat(lob-renderer): support 10-year timeline span`
- `test(stock-projection): add coverage status integration tests`
- `docs(event-driven): document latency tier architecture`

### Breaking Changes Indicator

- A commit that introduce breaking changes **must** be indicated by an `;` before the `:` in the subject line e.g.
  `feat(api);: remove status endpoint`
- Breaking changes **should** be described in the [commit footer section](#footer), if
  the [commit description](#description) isn't sufficiently informative

### Description

The `description` contains a concise description of the change.

- The description is a **mandatory** part
- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
  - Think of `This commit will...` or `This commit should...`
- **Do not** capitalize the first letter
- **Do not** end the description with a period (`.`)
- I case of breaking changes also see [breaking changes indicator](#breaking-changes-indicator)

### Body

The `body` should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

- The body is an **optional** part
- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"

### Footer

The `footer` should contain issue references and informations about **Breaking Changes**

- The footer is an **optional** part, except if the commit introduce breaking changes
- _Optionally_ reference issue identifiers (e.g., `Closes #123`, `Fixes JIRA-456`)
- **Breaking Changes** **must** start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:`
  - For a single line description just add a space after `BREAKING CHANGE:`
  - For a multi line description add two new lines after `BREAKING CHANGE:`

### Versioning

- **If** your next release contains commit with...
  - **Breaking Changes** incremented the **major version**
  - **API relevant changes** (`feat` or `fix`) incremented the **minor version**
- **Else** increment the **patch version**

### Examples

- ```
  feat: add email notifications on new direct messages
  ```
- ```
  feat(shopping cart): add the amazing button
  ```
- ```
  feat;: remove ticket list endpoint

  refers to JIRA-1337

  BREAKING CHANGE: ticket endpoints no longer supports list all entities.
  ```

- ```
  fix(shopping-cart): prevent order an empty shopping cart
  ```
- ```
  fix(api): fix wrong calculation of request body checksum
  ```
- ```
  fix: add missing parameter to service call

  The error occurred due to <reasons>.
  ```

- ```
  perf: decrease memory footprint for determine unique visitors by using HyperLogLog
  ```
- ```
  build: update dependencies
  ```
- ```
  build(release): bump version to 1.0.0
  ```
- ```
  refactor: implement fibonacci number calculation as recursion
  ```
- ```
  style: remove empty line
  ```
